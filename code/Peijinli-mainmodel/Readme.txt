mainmodel.py     : our main model. Others are more like trial to get the MSE
model.R          : final linear model prediction

the rest code package can be found at mainmodel.py 
don't forget to import them :)

data_cleaning.py : delete stopwords, expand abbreviation
deeplearning.py  : LSTM model due to the complexity, we didn't get this result
dependency.py    : based on grammar rule to select adjective
digdata.py       : all the feature generation expect the fastText score 
LDA.py           : LDA model fitting
NaiveBayesian.py : NaiveBayesian model fitting
SVM.py           : SVM model fitting
word2vec.py      : word2vec embeding method trial
